Maze Demo
========

This demo is about using long polling and WebSocket to build a
web-based chat room based on maze. This sample is borrowed from
a sample for beego, [WebIM](http://github.com/beego/samples).

If you are interested in peer-to-peer network, please join me in [Maze](http://github.com/lishaodong/Maze).
